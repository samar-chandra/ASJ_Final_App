NotesMiner : Your Digital Study Partner

# Problem Statement: 
During the pandemic era, many aspects of our lives changed, but that which was most affected was the education system. From the classroom to google meets, the mode of tutoring evolved. It has become increasingly difficult to take down notes and clear the doubts in the class itself. There is no repository for handwritten personalized notes, which are the main source of preparation for school and university-level examinations.

# Proposed Solution: 
The solution is an Android application that keeps track of personalized handwritten notes college-wise and then stream wise and then year-wise. For this app to function and its optimum capability, meritorious students from each year and each stream are contacted and are requested to provide their curated notes, these are then uploaded into the database and subsequent links are provided in the application. This way the application becomes conjunction which is a solution to every student study resource problem.

# Functionality and Concepts Used: 
The App has a very simple and interactive interface which helps the students select their stream, branch and year and get notes according to that information. Following are few android concepts used to achieve the functionalities in app :
•	Constraint Layout : Most of the activities in the app uses a flexible constraint layout, which is easy to handle for different screen sizes.
•	RecyclerView : To present the list of different streams and branches along with years we used the efficient recyclerview.
•	Room Database: To store the notes and related study material.

# Application Link & Future Scope :
The app is currently in the Alpha testing phase with CV Raman Global University with a limited no. of users, You can access the app : https://github.com/amisha64/ASJ_Final_App
Once the app is fully tested and functional in CV Raman Global University, Bhubaneswar, we plan to talk to neighboring colleges also to propose this app idea and collaborate with them on this service. We aim that by next year most of the colleges in our district will use this application to share notes with their students.
